## Image Classification with CNN
### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Throughout the project, I will carry out the full development pipeline: from loading and preprocessing images to building, training, and evaluating the model. Additionally, data and results will be visualized, and the model's performance will be tested on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy.
### Dataset Details 
The dataset Animals-10 used in this project is a collection of 26,179 labeled animal images distributed across 10 categories: dog, spider, chicken, horse, butterfly, cow, squirrel, sheep, cat, and elephant. There are no missing values, and each image is associated with a label and its corresponding encoded value. The dataset is well-balanced across several classes, though some categories, such as dog and spider, contain more samples than others like elephant or cat.
